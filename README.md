Readme Edits Re: Activity Directions:
 Born and raised in Colorado, I pursued my passion for science by studying molecular biology 
 and neuroscience at university. My career began in clinical labs, where I gained hands-on experience 
 before embarking on international adventures, living in Australia for a year and South Korea for two years. 
 During the COVID-19 pandemic, I pivoted to data analysis, working in a COVID lab, and later continued this path at 
 Meta. With a strong background in data analysis and a global perspective, Iâ€™m now ready to apply my skills as I learn 
 more about Data Science.
